# trianglearea(s1, s2, s3)[5pts]
# Write the function trianglearea(s1, s2, s3) that takes 3 floats/ints and returns the area of the
# triangle that has those lengths of its side. If no such triangle exists, return 0. Hint: you
# will probably wish to use Heron's Formula.


def trianglearea(s1, s2, s3):
	s = (s1 + s2 + s3)/2
	return (s * (s-s1) * (s-s2) * (s-s3))**0.5
